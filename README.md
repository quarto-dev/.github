# Quarto

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org).
Quarto documents are authored using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), an easy to write plain text format.

The main documentation for Quarto is the [Quarto web page](https://quarto.org).

Quarto has many different parts, and these are developed in different repositories:

* [Command-Line Interface](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli): the `quarto` command
* [VS Code and Positron Extension](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto/tree/main/apps/vscode): the source and visual editors in those IDEs
* [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions): the CI workflows
* [`quarto-ext`: Quarto extensions developed by Quartoâ€™s team](https://github.com/quarto-ext/)

The [`quarto-cli` discussion forum](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/) is where we host discussions, questions, help, and feature requests.
